        <p class="Links"><strong>What is organic farming?</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Organic  farming system in India  is not new and is being followed from ancient time. It is a method of farming  system which primarily aimed at cultivating the land and raising crops in such  a way, as to keep the soil alive and in good health by use of organic wastes  (crop, animal and farm wastes, aquatic wastes) and other biological materials  along with beneficial microbes (biofertilizers) to release nutrients to crops  for increased sustainable production in an eco friendly pollution free  environment. </p>
        <p align="justify">As  per the definition of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) study  team on organic farming &ldquo;organic farming is a system which avoids or largely  excludes the use of synthetic inputs (such as fertilizers, pesticides,  hormones, feed additives etc) and to the maximum extent feasible rely upon crop  rotations, crop residues, animal manures, off-farm organic waste, mineral grade  rock additives and biological system of nutrient mobilization and plant  protection&rdquo;. </p>
        <p align="justify">FAO suggested that &ldquo;Organic  agriculture is a unique production management system which promotes and  enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles and  soil biological activity, and this is accomplished by using on-farm agronomic,  biological and mechanical methods in exclusion of all synthetic off-farm  inputs&rdquo;. </p>
        <p align="center" class="Links"></p>
        <p align="left" class="Links"><strong>Need of organic farming</strong></p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links"> With the increase in population  our compulsion would be not only to stabilize agricultural production but to  increase it further in sustainable manner. The scientists have realized that  the &lsquo;Green Revolution&rsquo; with high input use has reached a plateau and is now  sustained with diminishing return of falling dividends. Thus, a natural balance  needs to be maintained at all cost for existence of life and property. The  obvious choice for that would be more relevant in the present era, when these  agrochemicals which are produced from fossil fuel and are not renewable and are  diminishing in availability. It may also cost heavily on our foreign exchange  in future.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links"><strong>The key characteristics  of organic farming include</strong></p>
        <ul class="jfy">
          <li>Protecting the long term fertility of soils by    maintaining organic matter levels, encouraging soil biological activity, and    careful mechanical intervention</li>
          <li>Providing crop nutrients indirectly using    relatively insoluble nutrient sources which are made available to the plant    by the action of soil micro-organisms</li>
          <li>Nitrogen self-sufficiency through the use of    legumes and biological nitrogen fixation, as well as effective recycling of    organic materials including crop residues and livestock manures</li>
          <li>Weed, disease and pest control relying primarily    on crop rotations, natural predators, diversity, organic manuring, resistant    varieties and limited (preferably minimal) thermal, biological and chemical    intervention</li>
          <li>The extensive management of livestock, paying    full regard to their evolutionary adaptations, behavioural needs and animal    welfare issues with respect to nutrition, housing, health, breeding and    rearing</li>
          <li>Careful attention to the impact of the farming    system on the wider environment and the conservation of wildlife and natural    habitats</li>
          </ul>

        <p align="center" class="Links"></p>

        <p align="left"><strong>Principle of health</strong></p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          Organic Agriculture should sustain  and enhance the health of soil, plant, animal, human and planet as one and  indivisible.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          This principle points out that the  health of individuals and communities cannot be separated from the health of  ecosystems - healthy soils produce healthy crops that foster the health of  animals and people.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          Health is the wholeness and  integrity of living systems. It is not simply the absence of illness, but the  maintenance of physical, mental, social and ecological well-being. Immunity,  resilience and regeneration are key characteristics of health.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          The role of organic agriculture,  whether in farming, processing, distribution, or consumption, is to sustain and  enhance the health of ecosystems and organisms from the smallest in the soil to  human beings. In particular, organic agriculture is intended to produce high  quality, nutritious food that contributes to preventive health care and  well-being. In view of this it should avoid the use of fertilizers, pesticides,  animal drugs and food additives that may have adverse health effects.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links"><strong>Principle of ecology</strong></p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          Organic Agriculture should be based  on living ecological systems and cycles, work with them, emulate them and help  sustain them.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          This principle roots organic agriculture within living ecological  systems. It states that production is to be based on ecological processes, and  recycling. Nourishment and well-being are achieved through the ecology of the  specific production environment. For example, in the case of crops this is the  living soil; for animals it is the farm ecosystem; for fish and marine  organisms, the aquatic environment.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          Organic farming, pastoral and wild  harvest systems should fit the cycles and ecological balances in nature. These  cycles are universal but their operation is site-specific. Organic management  must be adapted to local conditions, ecology, culture and scale. Inputs should  be reduced by reuse, recycling and efficient management of materials and energy  in order to maintain and improve environmental quality and conserve resources.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          Organic agriculture should attain  ecological balance through the design of farming systems, establishment of  habitats and maintenance of genetic and agricultural diversity. Those who  produce, process, trade, or consume organic products should protect and benefit  the common environment including landscapes, climate, habitats, biodiversity,  air and water.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links"><strong>Principle of fairness</strong></p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          Organic Agriculture should build on  relationships that ensure fairness with regard to the common environment and  life opportunities.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          Fairness is characterized by  equity, respect, justice and stewardship of the shared world, both among people  and in their relations to other living beings.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          This principle emphasizes that  those involved in organic agriculture should conduct human relationships in a  manner that ensures fairness at all levels and to all parties - farmers,  workers, processors, distributors, traders and consumers. Organic agriculture  should provide everyone involved with a good quality of life, and contribute to  food sovereignty and reduction of poverty. It aims to produce a sufficient  supply of good quality food and other products.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          This principle insists that animals  should be provided with the conditions and opportunities of life that accord  with their physiology, natural behavior and well-being.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          Natural and environmental resources  that are used for production and consumption should be managed in a way that is  socially and ecologically just and should be held in trust for future  generations. Fairness requires systems of production, distribution and trade  that are open and equitable and account for real environmental and social  costs.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links"><strong>Principle of care</strong></p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          Organic Agriculture should be  managed in a precautionary and responsible manner to protect the health and  well-being of current and future generations and the environment.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          Organic agriculture is a living and  dynamic system that responds to internal and external demands and conditions.  Practitioners of organic agriculture can enhance efficiency and increase  productivity, but this should not be at the risk of jeopardizing health and  well-being. Consequently, new technologies need to be assessed and existing  methods reviewed. Given the incomplete understanding of ecosystems and  agriculture, care must be taken.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="Links">          This principle states that  precaution and responsibility are the key concerns in management, development  and technology choices in organic agriculture. Science is necessary to ensure  that organic agriculture is healthy, safe and ecologically sound. However,  scientific knowledge alone is not sufficient. Practical experience, accumulated  wisdom and traditional and indigenous knowledge offer valid solutions, tested  by time. Organic agriculture should prevent significant risks by adopting  appropriate technologies and rejecting unpredictable ones, such as genetic  engineering. Decisions should reflect the values and needs of all who might be  affected, through transparent and participatory processes.</p>        </td>
